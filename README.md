## Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of a music dataset, focusing on various aspects such as track popularity (streams), artist details, release periods, and audio features (e.g., danceability, energy). The analysis is done through data manipulation, statistical computations, and visualization using Python.

The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships between different music features and metrics such as streams. Various visualizations were created to make the insights easier to interpret
